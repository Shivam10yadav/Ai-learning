> FlashMind is a smart, AI-driven study platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that transforms static PDFs into an interactive learning experience. It allows students to upload, read, and deeply understand study materials with the help of Google Gemini AI, making learning faster, smarter, and more personalized.
